# Face Recognition

This project is a Face Recognition using Deep Learning for low resolution video surveillance purposed for thesis only. The concept using Trunk Branch Ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (TBE CNN) architecture containt some pre-processing method like:

#### Super Resolution

- For enhancing low resolution image to high resolution.

#### Convolutional Neural Network

- CNN deep learning object recognition and feature extractions.

#### Inception model

- GoogLeNet pre-trained model that have reduction dimensionality.

#### Softmax layer

- For merging multidimension classifications on fully connected layer into one dimension classification.

#### Ensemble Approach

- There are 2 way to training model, ensemble and non-ensemble.

## Paper for this project will be publish soon.
